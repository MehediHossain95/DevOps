To create a security group in AWS that allows SSH access to master node from anywhere and enables communication between master and worker nodes for K3s, follow these steps:

Steps to Create and Configure the Security Group:
Log in to the AWS Management Console.

Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.

Click on "Security Groups" under the "Network & Security" section.

Create a new Security Group:

Click on the "Create security group" button.
Set the Name and Description for your security group.
VPC: Select the VPC that your instances are part of.
Add Inbound Rules:

Rule 1:
Type: SSH
Protocol: TCP
Port Range: 22
Source: 0.0.0.0/0
Description: Allow SSH access from anywhere.
Rule 2:
Type: Custom TCP
Protocol: TCP
Port Range: 6443
Source: Custom (Your VPC CIDR block or the IP range that includes your instances, e.g., 10.0.0.0/16)
Description: Allow K3s communication on the API server port.
Rule 3:
Type: All Traffic
Protocol: All
Port Range: All
Source: Custom (Use the IP range that includes your instances, e.g., 10.0.0.0/16)
Description: Allow all traffic between instances within the same VPC.
Add Outbound Rules (usually default to allow all):

Rule 1:
Type: All traffic
Protocol: All
Port Range: All
Destination: 0.0.0.0/0
Description: Allow all outbound traffic.
Create the Security Group by clicking the "Create security group" button.

Attach the Security Group to Your Instances:

Go to the "Instances" section in the EC2 Dashboard.
Select your master and worker instances.
Click on "Actions" -> "Networking" -> "Change Security Groups".
Select the newly created security group and apply the changes.
